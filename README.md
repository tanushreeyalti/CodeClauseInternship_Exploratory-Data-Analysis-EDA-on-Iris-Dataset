ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning.
The aim is to explore, visualize, and understand the relationships between different flower features, as well as analyze species distribution patterns.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
